# Instructions
If you already have EthanApiPlugin on your runelite already, it's probably fine to just grab `piggy-plugins-no-ethan-0.6.jar` and drag that into your `sideloaded-plugins` folder.

If you don't have EthanApiPlugin then you can grab `piggy-plugins-aio-0.6.jar` and drag that into your `sideloaded-plugins` folder.
